# Oanitic UI
How to Use:
- Download the files
- Drag and drop them into NaCl's source
- If it asks you to replace files, Click yes
- Patch up some things and press Compile
#### Misc
- The only diffrences here comparing this to the original src are that there is no menu content and that i removed all (or most) useless comments
- There is nothing diffrent in terms of installing the V1 menu to the Redone menu other than the fact that V1 has less files since less was changed
- The version that was used for the UI was 0.5 BETA whilst Redone uses Public Beta 221912
